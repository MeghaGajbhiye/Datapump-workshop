# Data Migration with Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service

Welcome to the Data Migration workshop. This workshop will walk you through the process of configuring Data Pump with Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud service in Linux Compute Instance... 

## Objectives
- Create Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service (ADWC) instance.
- Create compute instance.
- Configure Linux Environment for Datapump.
- Use expdp and impdp to export and import tables from ADWC.
- Use Object Storage to store dump files (.dmp) and import into the ADWC environment from it.
- Use the python script to import/export.

## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account with Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service.
- A public and a private ssh keys.
- SFTP Software to transfer files to compute instance. I have used Filezilla.
