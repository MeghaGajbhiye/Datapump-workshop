- **IMPORTANT** - Under my services, select from the drop down list the correct data center and click on **My Services**. If you are unsure of the data center you should select, and this is an in-person training event, ***ask your instructor*** which **Region** to select from the drop down list. If you received your account through an Oracle Trial, your Trial confirmation email should provide a URL that will pre-select the region for you.
